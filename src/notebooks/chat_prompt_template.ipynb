      "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams, usually consisting of eleven players each. The game originated in England and has grown to be popular in many countries, particularly in South Asia, Australia, England, and the Caribbean. Here are some key aspects of the game:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Basic Structure\n",
      "- **Field**: Cricket is played on a circular or oval-shaped field with a 22-yard-long pitch at the center.\n",
      "- **Teams**: Each team has 11 players, including batsmen, bowlers, and fielders.\n",
      "- **Innings**: Each team typically has one or two innings, depending on the format of the game. An innings is the period in which one team bats and attempts to score runs while the other bowls and fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Formats\n",
      "Cricket is played in various formats, including:\n",
      "- **Test Cricket**: The traditional format, lasting up to five days with two innings per team. It allows for a more strategic and tactical game.\n",
      "- **One Day Internationals (ODIs)**: Each team faces a fixed number of overs, typically 50. This format is shorter than Test matches and is completed in one day.\n",
      "- **Twenty20 (T20)**: A much shorter format where each team plays 20 overs. This format is popular for its fast pace and entertainment value.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Rules\n",
      "- **Batting**: The batting team tries to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets or by hitting the ball to the boundary (four runs if it hits the ground before crossing the boundary; six runs if it crosses without touching the ground).\n",
      "- **Bowling**: The bowling team aims to get the batsmen out through various methods, including bowling them out (hitting the wicket), catching the ball after a hit but before it touches the ground, or running them out.\n",
      "- **Fielding**: Fielders support bowlers in preventing runs and catching the ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Competitions\n",
      "Cricket has several prestigious competitions, including:\n",
      "- The ICC Cricket World Cup (ODI)\n",

      "2. **Duration**: A standard match consists of two halves, each lasting 45 minutes, with a halftime break in between.\n",
      "3. **Field**: The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end.\n",
      "4. **Offside Rule**: Players must not be in an offside position when the ball is played to them.\n",
