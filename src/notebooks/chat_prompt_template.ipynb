      "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams, each consisting of eleven players. It is popular in many countries, especially in England, Australia, India, Pakistan, South Africa, and the West Indies. Here are some key aspects of the game:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Basic Structure:\n",
      "- **Field:** Cricket is played on a large circular or oval field with a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch at the center.\n",
      "- **Innings:** Each team has a turn to bat and a turn to bowl/field. An innings ends when ten batsmen are out or a predetermined number of overs has been bowled.\n",
      "- **Overs:** An over consists of six legal deliveries bowled by a bowler. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Roles:\n",
      "- **Batsmen:** The primary objective of the batsmen is to score runs. They do this by hitting the ball and running between two sets of wickets (three wooden stumps topped by two bails).\n",
      "- **Bowlers:** The bowlers aim to dismiss batsmen by getting them out in various ways (e.g., bowled, caught, LBW, etc.) and restricting runs.\n",
      "- **Fielders:** The fielding team supports the bowler by trying to catch the ball, stop runs, and dismiss batsmen.\n",

      "- **Test Cricket:** The longest format, played over five days with each team batting twice. It is considered the highest standard of the game.\n",
      "- **One Day Internationals (ODIs):** Each team bats for a fixed number of overs, usually 50. The match typically lasts around 8 hours.\n",
      "- **Twenty20 (T20):** A shorter format where each team bats for 20 overs. These matches usually last about 3 hours and are designed for a quick and entertaining experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Competitions:\n",
      "- **ICC Cricket World Cup:** The premier championship of One Day International cricket.\n",
      "- **ICC T20 World Cup:** The championship for the T20 format.\n",
